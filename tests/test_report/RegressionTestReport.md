# Regression Test Report

*Date: June 5, 2025*

Regression tests ensure previous functionality remains intact after changes.

- **get_recent_zero_returns_empty:** verifies that requesting zero recent items yields an empty result.
- **inserting_trace_preserves_id:** ensures inserted temporal traces keep their IDs when retrieved.

All regression tests pass.
