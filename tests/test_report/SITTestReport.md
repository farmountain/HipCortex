# System Integration Test Report

*Date: June 5, 2025*

This report summarizes the system integration tests validating interactions across modules.

- **memory_round_trip:** inserts a symbolic node, stores it in temporal memory, adapts a perception input, and verifies retrieval.
- **integration_and_reflexion:** initializes the IntegrationLayer and AureusBridge together without errors.
- **store_reasoning_trace_via_adapter_and_indexer:** validates storing a text percept as a temporal trace.

All system integration tests pass, confirming basic cross-module functionality.
