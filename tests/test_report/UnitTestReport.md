# Unit Test Report

*Date: June 5, 2025*

This report summarizes the unit tests implemented and passed for the HipCortex MVP features.

---

## 1. TemporalIndexer (in `integration_tests.rs`)
- **Insert and retrieve traces:**
  Verifies that inserted traces can be retrieved and are correct.
- **Buffer overflow:**
  Ensures that when the buffer is full, the oldest trace is removed (LRU behavior).
- **Decay and prune:**
  Confirms that traces are pruned after their relevance decays below a threshold.
- **Remove and get:**
  Validates trace removal and retrieval by ID.
- **Decay factor:**
  Checks that per-trace decay factors influence pruning.

## 2. ProceduralCache (in `integration_tests.rs`)
- **FSM transitions:**
  Tests valid state transitions in the procedural finite state machine.
- **Invalid FSM transition:**
  Ensures that invalid transitions do not change the state.
- **Remove and reset:**
  Exercises trace removal and resetting to the start state.

## 3. SymbolicStore (in `symbolic_store_tests.rs`)
- **Add and get node:**
  Checks that nodes can be added and retrieved by ID.
- **Add edge and neighbors:**
  Verifies that edges can be added and neighbor queries return correct nodes.
- **Add edge to nonexistent node:**
  Ensures that adding an edge to a nonexistent node does not break neighbor queries.
- **Duplicate node:**
  Confirms that adding nodes with the same label creates unique nodes.
- **Edges from query:**
  Tests retrieving outgoing edges for a node.
- **Query by label and property:**
  Verifies retrieving nodes via label and property filters.

## 4. PerceptionAdapter (in `perception_adapter_tests.rs`)
- **Adapt text input:**
  Tests adapting a text input.
- **Adapt embedding input:**
  Tests adapting an embedding input.
- **Adapt invalid input:**
  Ensures the adapter handles unsupported/empty input gracefully.
- **Adapt image input:**
  Tests adapting an image payload.
- **Adapt symbolic concept:**
  Tests handling symbolic concept modality.

## 5. IntegrationLayer (in `integration_layer_tests.rs`)
- **Connect:**
  Tests that the integration layer can be created and connected.
- **Multiple connects:**
  Ensures that calling connect multiple times does not cause errors.
- **Send and disconnect:**
  Validates message sending and disconnection behavior.
- **Connection state:**
  Checks the `is_connected` helper.

## 6. AureusBridge (in `aureus_bridge_tests.rs`)
- **Reflexion loop:**
  Tests that the reflexion loop can be started.
- **Multiple reflexion loops:**
  Ensures that calling the reflexion loop multiple times is safe.
- **Loop counter reset:**
   Verifies loop counting and reset functionality.
- **Chain-of-thought prompt:**
  Ensures enabling CoT prefixes the prompt and stores the result.

## 7. Reasoning trace store (in `reasoning_trace_store_tests.rs`)
- **Store trace after perception:**
  Confirms that adapting a percept and inserting it into the TemporalIndexer retains the trace.
- **PerceptionAdapter compression:**
  Verifies `PerceptionAdapter::adapt` returns a compressed embedding when given raw image data.

## 8. RAG and Export Modules (in `rag_adapter_tests.rs` and `knowledge_export_tests.rs`)
- **local_rag_retrieve_match:** validates the local adapter returns matching labels.
- **pdf_export_creates_file:** ensures PDF export writes output successfully.
- **notion_export_sends_request:** verifies an HTTP request is sent when exporting to Notion.

**Result:**  
All the above unit tests have passed successfully, confirming the core logic and interfaces of your MVP modules are functioning as intended.
