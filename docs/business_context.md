# Business Context

HipCortex provides a modular foundation for building agent memory and reasoning services. It can be embedded in edge devices or scaled out as a microservice. Typical use cases include:

- Conversational agents that need context persistence and reasoning over time.
- Workflow automation on resource constrained hardware.
- Knowledge graph or retrievalâ€‘augmented pipelines.
- Research platforms exploring symbolic and procedural memory.

The project is written in Rust to ensure performance and safety, with optional web and desktop frontends.
