# HipCortex Memory Design

HipCortex extends classic memory engines with mathematically verified and logically
consistent symbolic reasoning. This document summarizes the principles and
component level flow so developers can reason about the engine at every step.

## Core Philosophy

HipCortex Memory is more than a storage layer. Each operation is grounded in
formal mathematics and checked with logic rules so recorded knowledge is
traceable and provably correct.

## Unified Design Principles

| Principle | How it is Applied |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Mathematical Validity** | Modules rely on PCA, Markov chains, graph theory, automata and Bayesian inference |
| **Logical Consistency** | Memory writes and transitions are guarded by propositional and predicate logic checks |
| **Symbolic Reasoning** | Data is parsed and stored as symbols (graphs, FSM states, logical predicates) |
| **Chain-of-Thought Verifiability** | Each reasoning step can be inspected as a series of logic rules and symbolic transforms |
| **Self-Correcting** | Contradictions are detected and resolved at runtime |
| **Compression with Fidelity** | Embeddings and graph deltas obey entropy bounds |

## Component Design

### PerceptionAdapter
*Normalises raw input into symbols and decorrelated features.*
- **Math**: PCA / ICA decorrelate embeddings.
- **Logic**: Output symbols follow a schema.
- **Symbolic**: `"Paris" -> Symbol(Place, Paris)` then embedded.
- **CoT Flow**: Input -> Symbol Parse -> PCA -> Output vector.

### TemporalIndexer
*Buffers perception traces ordered by time.*
- **Math**: Markov chain predicts next state; Poisson models bursty input.
- **Logic**: Ordering preserves cause/effect relations.
- **Symbolic**: Trace stored as `(Actor, Action, Context, Time)`.
- **CoT Flow**: Append trace -> Update state -> Predict next trace.

### SymbolicStore
*Memory graph for semantic context.*
- **Math**: Graph connectivity, centrality, clustering.
- **Logic**: Typed predicates such as `LocatedIn(A,B)`.
- **Symbolic**: Nodes are symbols, edges are logical relations.
- **CoT Flow**: Insert node -> Connect edges -> Validate graph.

### ProceduralCache
*Finite state workflow planning.*
- **Math**: Automata theory and state transition matrices.
- **Logic**: Transitions follow predefined rules.
- **Symbolic**: States and transitions are rewrite rules.
- **CoT Flow**: Observe event -> Match rule -> Apply transition.

### AureusBridge
*Reasoning loop orchestrator.*
- **Math**: Bayesian inference with Monte Carlo sampling.
- **Logic**: Conflicting hypotheses are pruned.
- **Symbolic**: Hypotheses stored as formulas.
- **CoT Flow**: Check belief -> Gather evidence -> Update belief.

### HypothesisManager
*Maintains multiple competing hypotheses.*
- **Math**: Statistical testing with probability bounds.
- **Logic**: Hypotheses may be exclusive or complementary.
- **Symbolic**: Tree of hypotheses.
- **CoT Flow**: Rank hypotheses -> Drop weak ones.

### SemanticCompression
*Stores minimal data while preserving meaning.*
- **Math**: Entropy bounds and source coding theorem.
- **Logic**: Removes only logically redundant symbols.
- **Symbolic**: Graph delta encoding.
- **CoT Flow**: Compute entropy -> Compress -> Validate lossless.

### AuditLog
*Verifiable trace of all events.*
- **Math**: Log likelihood estimation detects anomalies.
- **Logic**: Contradictory actions are flagged.
- **Symbolic**: Log entries are assertions.
- **CoT Flow**: Log event -> Check consistency -> Flag anomaly.

### IntegrationLayer
*Exposes memory via API.*
- **Math**: Queuing theory controls load.
- **Logic**: Inputs validated as logical schemas.
- **Symbolic**: Requests and results are symbolic tuples.
- **CoT Flow**: Receive request -> Validate -> Respond.

## Chain-of-Thought Usability Flow

| Step | Logic | Symbolic | Math |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| User input | Parsed into valid predicates | Symbols generated | PCA decorrelation |
| Memory trace | Ordered and contradiction free | Timestamped tuples | Markov chain order |
| Graph context | Verified connectivity | Predicate edges | Centrality metrics |
| Action FSM | Valid transitions | Rewrite rules | Transition matrix |
| Reasoning | Consistent belief updates | Hypothesis tree | Bayesian update |
| Compression | Only logical base kept | Graph deltas | Entropy bound |
| Logs | Truth-preserving assertions | Symbolic logs | Log likelihood |
| APIs | Schema-checked input/output | Symbolic messages | Queue throughput |

## Usability and Enhancement

**User Benefits**
- Logical answers with explainable chains of reasoning.
- Memory consistency across sessions.
- Optional dashboard for live inspection.
- Compression keeps storage lean.

**Developer Benefits**
- Modular perception or reasoning can be swapped easily.
- Symbolic constraints catch bugs.
- Logic guards prevent invalid memory states.
- Memory footprint remains minimal and consistent.

## Next Actions
- Expand README and architecture docs with these guarantees.
- Add property tests for graph connectivity and FSM reachability.
- Inline comments show chain-of-thought steps within modules.
