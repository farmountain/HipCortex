# Integration Guide

This document describes how to integrate HipCortex with agent frameworks, APIs, and external systems.

## Integration Readiness

### REST/gRPC API
- IntegrationLayer (`src/integration_layer.rs`) is structured to expose REST/gRPC endpoints.
- To implement a REST server: use [actix-web](https://actix.rs/) or [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).
- To implement gRPC: use [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic).

### Agent Protocols (Planned)
- OpenManus and MCP: Protocol stubs ready; bridge implementation in IntegrationLayer and AureusBridge.
- Accept agent messages via PerceptionAdapter, return actions/results via IntegrationLayer.

### Chain-of-Thought & Reflexion
- AureusBridge connects to agentic/LLM reasoning modules.
- Supports embedding AUREUS or other CoT frameworks for feedback loops.

### LLM Connectors
- Basic clients exist for OpenAI, Claude, and Ollama.
- Planned support for additional open-source models and local inference.

### RAG & Notion/PDF Export (Planned)
- SymbolicStore and ProceduralCache can be connected to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backends.
- Exporters for Notion/PDF will be implemented for memory tracing and reporting.

### Real-Time CLI/Web (Planned)
- CLI and web server interface planned for live agentic memory debugging and management.

## How To Integrate

1. Implement your REST/gRPC server in `integration_layer.rs`.
2. Use PerceptionAdapter to receive inputs from your agent, CLI, or web API.
3. Process memory/logic as needed (STM, FSM, symbolic, etc.).
4. Use IntegrationLayer to return results, traces, or actions.
5. Extend with protocol adapters for OpenManus, MCP, or other frameworks.
