# HipCortex

A modular, agentic AI memory engine for reasoning, edge, and multi-agent workflows.  
Built in Rust, integrating temporal, procedural, and symbolic memory with agentic and multimodal APIs.

---

## ‚ú® Features

HipCortex is built from modular building blocks so you can mix and match memory
and reasoning components.

- **Temporal Indexer:** Short/long-term buffer with decay and LRU pruning.
- **Procedural FSM Cache:** Regenerative memory driven by finite state logic for
  workflows and actions.
- **Symbolic Store:** Graph-based concept store with semantic key/value pairs.
- **Perception Adapter:** Multimodal input handler (text, embeddings, agent
  messages, vision‚Äîplanned).
- **Aureus Bridge:** Reflexion and reasoning hook for chain-of-thought engines.
- **Integration Layer:** REST/gRPC and protocol stubs (OpenManus, MCP).
- **Fully Test-Driven:** Extensive unit tests and Criterion benchmarks.

## üöÄ Quickstart

```sh
git clone <your-repo>
cd hipcortex
cargo build
cargo test        # Run all tests
cargo run         # Run the CLI demo
cargo bench       # Run benchmarks
```

See examples/quickstart.rs for a minimal programmatic usage demo.

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

HipCortex can serve a variety of scenarios:

- **Agent Memory Engine:** manage conversation context and reasoning traces for single or multi-agent systems.
- **Edge Workflow Execution:** run on resource-constrained hardware thanks to Rust's performance and small footprint.
- **Search & Retrieval:** build knowledge graphs or retrieval-augmented generation pipelines using the SymbolicStore and TemporalIndexer.
- **Real-Time Interfaces:** expose REST/gRPC APIs and upcoming CLI/web dashboards via the IntegrationLayer.
- **Knowledge Export:** connect to Notion, PDF, or other backends for long-term persistence (planned).
## üß™ Test & Automation
- **Run all tests:**  
  `cargo test`

- **Run benchmarks:**  
  `cargo bench`

- **Test suite:**  
  - Unit and integration tests: `/tests/integration_tests.rs`
  - Property-based/fuzz tests: integrated using [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest)
  - Add new test files to `/tests/` as needed

- **CI/CD Ready:**  
  You can use GitHub Actions or any CI provider‚Äîadd `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (see Rust starter templates) to run on every PR or push.

- **VS Code Integration:**  
  Open with VS Code. Test & bench tasks are already available via `.vscode/tasks.json` (Ctrl+Shift+B).

- **Best Practices:**  
  - Always write failing tests first (TDD)
  - Ensure all modules have coverage before merge
  - Add benchmarks for any new algorithm or data structure
