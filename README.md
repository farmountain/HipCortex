**AI coding agents forget decisions, re-read the same context, and burn tokens — HipCortex is local persistent memory you install once so Claude, Cursor, VS Code, and your Python/TS agents remember what matters and spend less on every turn.**

⭐ **If that solves a pain you feel, [star the repo](https://github.com/farmountain/HipCortex)** — it helps others find it.

## Why it exists

Long agent sessions either dump full chat history into the prompt (expensive, noisy) or forget yesterday’s decisions (frustrating). HipCortex stores memories as a **local causal graph**, serves them over **HTTP + MCP**, and injects **only the small, relevant slice** your agent needs next.

| You get | Without HipCortex |
|--------|-------------------|
| Decisions persist across sessions | “We already decided that” — lost |
| Smaller prompts (Headroom / Caveman modes) | Context stuffing & higher API cost |
| One install for many hosts | Hand-edited MCP configs per tool |
| Runs on your machine (Win / macOS / Linux) | Cloud-only memory lock-in |

## Install in 60 seconds

Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

```bash
pip install -U hipcortex
hipcortex install          # pick your IDE (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, Grok, …)
hipcortex start            # local server on http://127.0.0.1:3030
hipcortex doctor           # health check
```

Non-interactive:

```bash
hipcortex install --yes
hipcortex install --url https://hipcortex.fly.dev   # optional managed endpoint
```

**TypeScript client:**

```bash
npm install hipcortex
```

**VS Code / Antigravity VSIX** (multi-OS server binaries bundled; extension **0.8.0**):  
Package from repo (`vscode-extension`) or latest GitHub Release VSIX. Mac/Linux auto-`chmod` bundled bins.

```bash
code --install-extension hipcortex-memory-0.8.0.vsix
```

## 60-second usage

**Python**

```python
from hipcortex import HipCortexClient

client = HipCortexClient("http://127.0.0.1:3030")
client.add_memory(actor="alice", action="decided", target="Use Postgres for sessions")
print(client.search("sessions", limit=5))
# client.forget("alice")  # GDPR-style wipe for an actor
```

**TypeScript**

```typescript
import { HipCortexClient } from "hipcortex";

const client = new HipCortexClient({ baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:3030" });
await client.addMemory({ actor: "alice", action: "decided", target: "Use Postgres" });
const { results } = await client.search({ query: "Postgres", limit: 5 });
```

**Live try (no local install)**

```bash
curl https://hipcortex.fly.dev/health
```

## Where it plugs in

| Surface | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Claude Code** | `hipcortex install` → skill + optional `--mode proactive` |
| **Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf / Grok / …** | MCP config via wizard |
| **Python agents** | `pip install hipcortex` + LangChain / CrewAI / AutoGen adapters |
| **Node agents** | `npm install hipcortex` |
| **Rust core** | Local `webserver` binary from [Releases](https://github.com/farmountain/HipCortex/releases) |

## What “good” looks like

- **Remember** → agent stops re-asking the same project decisions  
- **Recall** → search / live beliefs return the right fact in one call  
- **Lean context** → fewer tokens than pasting full history  
- **Yours** → data stays local unless you point at a remote URL
