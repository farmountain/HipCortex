# HipCortex

A modular, agentic AI memory engine for reasoning, edge, and multi-agent workflows.
Built in Rust, integrating temporal, procedural, and symbolic memory with agentic and multimodal APIs.

## üîç Problem
AI agents often lack persistent, contextual memory. Without a unified engine it
is difficult to reason over time or across modalities.

## üéØ Mission
HipCortex aims to provide a memory engine that blends symbolic reasoning,
temporal relevance, procedural logic and perception in one modular package.

## üìò Business Context
HipCortex enables persistent memory and reasoning for bots and edge automation. It can operate as a lightweight library, a REST microservice or a desktop app. See [docs/business_context.md](docs/business_context.md) for details.

## ‚ú® Features

HipCortex is built from modular building blocks so you can mix and match memory
and reasoning components.

- **Temporal Indexer:** Short/long-term buffer with decay and LRU pruning.
- **Procedural FSM Cache:** Regenerative memory driven by finite state logic for
  workflows and actions.
- **Symbolic Store:** Graph-based concept store with semantic key/value pairs.
  Backed by a pluggable `GraphDatabase` trait for in-memory or persistent graphs
  (via the optional `SledGraph` backend).
- **Perception Adapter:** Multimodal input handler (text, embeddings, agent
  messages, vision). Includes a simple VisionEncoder for image embeddings.
- **Aureus Bridge:** Reflexion and reasoning hook for chain-of-thought engines.
- **Integration Layer:** REST/gRPC and protocol stubs (OpenManus, MCP).
- **Fully Test-Driven:** Extensive unit tests and Criterion benchmarks.
- **Optional Web Server:** compile with `--features web-server` for an Axum REST API.
- **Optional GUI:** compile with `--features gui` to launch a Tauri desktop client.
- **RocksDB Backend:** use `MemoryStore::new_rocksdb` for an embedded key-value database.
- **Effort Evaluator & Confidence Regulator (planned):** track reasoning fatigue and decay to prevent collapse.
- **Hypothesis Manager (planned):** maintain multiple reasoning paths and a quantized state tree for backtracking.
- **Puzzle Benchmark Suite (planned):** validates complex planning algorithms like Tower of Hanoi and 8-puzzle.

## üöÄ Quickstart

```sh
git clone <your-repo>
cd hipcortex
cargo build
cargo test        # Run all tests
cargo run         # Run the CLI demo
cargo bench       # Run benchmarks
```

If you encounter Codex container timeouts, run `scripts/codex_startup.sh` before heavy builds to prefetch dependencies and perform a quick `cargo check --all-features`.

See examples/quickstart.rs for a minimal programmatic usage demo.
Detailed data model and extended architecture diagrams are available in [docs/data_model.md](docs/data_model.md) and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

HipCortex can serve a variety of scenarios:

- **Agentic AI via OpenManus:** manage conversation context and reasoning traces for single or multi-agent systems.
- **AUREUS Reflexion loops:** integrate chain-of-thought feedback for deeper reasoning.
- **Edge Workflow Execution:** run on resource-constrained hardware thanks to Rust's performance and small footprint.
- **Multimodal learning or smart glasses:** use the PerceptionAdapter to capture images and text.
- **Real-Time Automation:** expose REST/gRPC APIs and upcoming CLI/web dashboards via the IntegrationLayer.
- **Knowledge Export:** connect to Notion, PDF, or other backends for long-term persistence (planned).

## üë• Key User Roles
- **AI Agent** ‚Äì stores traces and retrieves context.
- **Developer** ‚Äì integrates the engine via REST/gRPC or protocol adapters.
- **Architect** ‚Äì designs workflows and multi-agent systems using the modules.
- **Researcher** ‚Äì experiments with new memory types or reasoning loops.

## üó∫Ô∏è Use Case Map
1. **Store reasoning trace** through the PerceptionAdapter and TemporalIndexer.
2. **Query symbols** from the SymbolicStore.
3. **Update state** via the ProceduralCache or AureusBridge.
4. **Visualize world model** using upcoming CLI or web dashboards.
## üß™ Test & Automation
- **Run all tests:**  
  `cargo test`

- **Run benchmarks:**  
  `cargo bench`

- **Test suite:**  
  - Unit and integration tests: `/tests/integration_tests.rs`
  - Property-based/fuzz tests: integrated using [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest)
  - Add new test files to `/tests/` as needed

- **CI/CD Ready:**  
  You can use GitHub Actions or any CI provider‚Äîadd `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (see Rust starter templates) to run on every PR or push.

- **VS Code Integration:**  
  Open with VS Code. Test & bench tasks are already available via `.vscode/tasks.json` (Ctrl+Shift+B).

- **Best Practices:**
  - Always write failing tests first (TDD)
  - Ensure all modules have coverage before merge
  - Add benchmarks for any new algorithm or data structure
