# HipCortex

A modular, agentic AI memory engine for reasoning, edge, and multi-agent workflows.
Built in Rust, integrating temporal, procedural, and symbolic memory with agentic and multimodal APIs.

## üîç Problem
AI agents often lack persistent, contextual memory. Without a unified engine it
is difficult to reason over time or across modalities.

## üéØ Mission
HipCortex aims to provide a memory engine that blends symbolic reasoning,
temporal relevance, procedural logic and perception in one modular package.
**HipCortex Memory: Math, Logic, Symbolic Guarantees** ‚Äì reasoning steps follow proven models with logic checks. See [docs/memory_design.md](docs/memory_design.md).

### üî¨ Memory Design Extension
HipCortex now ships with a mathematically proven memory layer. Logical
predicates validate each write, symbolic graphs track context and property-based
tests confirm graph connectivity and FSM reachability. Every module begins with
a "Chain-of-Thought" comment summarizing its reasoning flow.


## üìò Business Context
HipCortex enables persistent memory and reasoning for bots and edge automation. It can operate as a lightweight library, a REST microservice or a desktop app. See [docs/business_context.md](docs/business_context.md) for details.

## ‚ú® Features

HipCortex is built from modular building blocks so you can mix and match memory
and reasoning components.

- **AuditLog:** Hash-chained entries provide tamper-evident persistence for all
  memory writes.
- **Temporal Indexer:** Segmented ring buffer with per-trace decay factors and
  LRU pruning for short/long-term memory.
- **Procedural FSM Cache:** Regenerative memory driven by finite state logic for
  workflows and actions. Supports batch advancement of traces.
- **Symbolic Store:** Graph-based concept store with semantic key/value pairs.
  Caches recent label lookups with an LRU cache. Backed by a pluggable
  `GraphDatabase` trait for in-memory or persistent graphs (via the optional
  `SledGraph` backend).
- **Perception Adapter:** Multimodal input handler (text, embeddings, agent
  messages, vision). Includes a simple VisionEncoder for image embeddings.
- **Semantic Compression:** Reduce embedding dimensionality with
  `semantic_compression::compress_embedding` for efficient storage.
- **Aureus Bridge:** Reflexion and reasoning hook for chain-of-thought engines.
- **Integration Layer:** REST/gRPC and protocol stubs (OpenManus, MCP).
- **MCP Server:** run both REST and gRPC endpoints to orchestrate symbolic context for multiple agents.
- **Math & Logic Guarantees:** memory operations validated with formal proofs and symbolic checks.
- **Fully Test-Driven:** Extensive unit tests and Criterion benchmarks.
- **Optional Web Server:** compile with `--features web-server` for an Axum REST API.
- **Optional GUI:** compile with `--features gui` to launch a Tauri desktop client.
- **RocksDB Backend:** compile with `--features rocksdb-backend` and use `MemoryStore::new_rocksdb` for an embedded key-value database.
- **WASM Plugin Host:** compile with `--features plugin` to run custom WebAssembly extensions via `PluginHost`.
- **Effort Evaluator & Confidence Regulator:** monitor reasoning effort and confidence to avoid collapse.
- **Hypothesis Manager:** maintain multiple reasoning paths and a quantized state tree for backtracking.
- **Enhancement Advisor:** analyze module metrics and recommend improvements for human review.
- **Puzzle Benchmark Suite:** validates complex planning algorithms like Tower of Hanoi and 8-puzzle.

## üöÄ Quickstart

```sh
git clone <your-repo>
cd hipcortex
cargo build
cargo test        # Run all tests
cargo run         # Run the CLI demo
cargo bench       # Run benchmarks
```

Launch the combined MCP server (REST + gRPC) with:

```sh
cargo run --example mcp_server --features "web-server,grpc-server"
```

How to Test as User:
https://github.com/farmountain/HipCortex/blob/main/How%20to%20Test%20as%20a%20User

If you encounter Codex container timeouts, run `scripts/codex_startup.sh` before heavy builds to prefetch dependencies and perform a quick `cargo check --all-features`.

See `examples/quickstart.rs` for a minimal programmatic usage demo.
`examples/world_model_example.rs` demonstrates the persistent world model API.
The new `examples/rag_export.rs` shows retrieving content via the RAG adapter and exporting it to PDF.
For WebAssembly extension, see `examples/plugin_host.rs` and run:
`cargo run --example plugin_host --features plugin`.
Detailed data model and extended architecture diagrams are available in [docs/data_model.md](docs/data_model.md) and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases


- **Agentic AI via OpenManus:** manage conversation context and reasoning traces for single or multi-agent systems.
- **AUREUS Reflexion loops:** integrate chain-of-thought feedback for deeper reasoning.
- **Edge Workflow Execution:** run on resource-constrained hardware thanks to Rust's performance and small footprint.
- **Multimodal learning or smart glasses:** use the PerceptionAdapter to capture images and text.
- **Real-Time Automation:** expose REST/gRPC APIs and upcoming CLI/web dashboards via the IntegrationLayer.
- **Knowledge Export:** use `rag_adapter` with `PdfExporter` or `NotionExporter` for long-term persistence.

## üë• Key User Roles
- **AI Agent** ‚Äì stores traces and retrieves context.
- **Developer** ‚Äì integrates the engine via REST/gRPC or protocol adapters.
- **Architect** ‚Äì designs workflows and multi-agent systems using the modules.
- **Researcher** ‚Äì experiments with new memory types or reasoning loops.

## üó∫Ô∏è Use Case Map
1. **Store reasoning trace** through the PerceptionAdapter and TemporalIndexer.
2. **Query symbols** from the SymbolicStore.
3. **Update state** via the ProceduralCache or AureusBridge.
4. **Visualize world model** using real-time CLI and web dashboards.
## üß™ Test & Automation
- **Run all tests:**  
  `cargo test`

- **Run benchmarks:**  
  `cargo bench`

- **Test suite:**
  - Unit and integration tests: `/tests/integration_tests.rs`
  - Property-based/fuzz tests: integrated using [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest)
  - Add new test files to `/tests/` as needed
  - Additional examples cover multimodal smart-glasses and humanoid robotics perception traces
  - Recent perception tests: `multimodal_perception_tests.rs`, `smart_glasses_sit.rs`, `humanoid_perception_uat.rs`

- **CI/CD Ready:**  
  You can use GitHub Actions or any CI provider‚Äîadd `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (see Rust starter templates) to run on every PR or push.

- **VS Code Integration:**  
  Open with VS Code. Test & bench tasks are already available via `.vscode/tasks.json` (Ctrl+Shift+B).

- **Best Practices:**
  - Always write failing tests first (TDD)
  - Ensure all modules have coverage before merge
  - Add benchmarks for any new algorithm or data structure

## üèÜ Project Success Criteria

HipCortex aims to remain stable and extensible as the ecosystem grows. The core
success criteria include:

- **Technical Architecture** ‚Äì all modules compile cleanly and interoperate as
  described in the architecture diagram.
- **Data Integrity & Consistency** ‚Äì no reasoning traces or symbolic graphs are
  lost or corrupted across sessions.
- **Scalability & Performance** ‚Äì memory usage and runtime must support edge
  constraints while scaling horizontally on servers.
- **Extensibility** ‚Äì pluggable perception encoders, symbolic stores and caches
  should be swappable without modifying core logic.
- **Observability & Debugging** ‚Äì real-time logging and dashboards provide a
  clear view of every state transition.
- **Math & Statistical Soundness** ‚Äì temporal indexes, concept graphs and FSM
  transitions follow well-defined models validated by tests or simulation.
- **Integration with LLMs** ‚Äì connectors and protocols handle context without
  hallucination drift.
- **Documentation & Community** ‚Äì README, architecture docs and examples remain
  up to date for contributors.

## üìä Critical Data & Math Foundation

Each value stream collects metrics that align with solid statistical models.
Examples include:

- *PerceptionAdapter* ‚Äì input token entropy and PCA/ICA statistics.
- *TemporalIndexer* ‚Äì trace lifetimes modeled with Markov chains.
- *SymbolicStore* ‚Äì graph degree variance and clustering coefficients.
- *ProceduralCache* ‚Äì FSM state transition matrices and ergodicity checks.
- *AureusBridge* ‚Äì Bayesian inference metrics for reasoning loops.
- *IntegrationLayer* ‚Äì API latency and queuing statistics.
